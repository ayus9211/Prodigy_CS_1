Caesar Cipher: Encryption and Decryption

This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher, a straightforward substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features Encryption: Secure your messages by shifting each letter using a chosen key. Decryption: Easily reverse the process using the same key to reveal the original message. Case Sensitivity: Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Easy-to-Use: Offers a user-friendly command-line interface for encryption and decryption. Visual Clarity: Displays outputs with different colors for better readability. How to Use Clone this repository to your computer.

Run the Python script:

python main.py

Select the operation:

Press 1 to encrypt a message. Press 2 to decrypt a message. Input your message when prompted.

Enter the shift value (integer). This value must be between 0 and 25 or any positive/negative integer. If the value exceeds 25, it wraps around the alphabet.

View the result: The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

To use the program again, type yes when asked. To exit, type no.

Example Usage Encryption: Choose 1, input your message, and provide a shift value. Decryption: Choose 2, input the encrypted message, and use the correct shift value. Contributions Contributions and feedback are welcome! Fork this repository and submit pull requests to improve the program.
